# SQL_EDA_PROJECT
Hi This is my First Hands on SQL Project delving in Basic Exploratory Data Analytics

This project consists of using simple SQL statements to using advanced queries and sub queries all in one query file to be executed in Microsoft Sql Server

The data had been taken from - https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data
The data source - owid-covid-data.csv 

Note : This project is not performed on latest updated data 
The data worked on in this sql query is from the date 23rd April 2024 -23/04/2024 which is present in the repository as "cowid-covid-data-April-23-2024-updated"
